One facet that makes Google [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/) (and Mozilla [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)) awesome is the concept of *Extensions* or *Plugins* (Internet Explorer eventually joined the party, but so late that both Chrome & Firefox blow it ‘outta the water’). Extensions & plugins essentially add functionality to your web browser, so that your browser is not only for viewing web pages.

Two of my favorite Chrome extensions are (i) [Boards for Trello](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trello/oflhioojkbelepjlnafgmgkkjhojphcg) and (ii) Google [Hangouts](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hangouts/nckgahadagoaajjgafhacjanaoiihapd). The Trello extension essentially converts your web browser into a Kanban board and the Hangouts extension turns your browser into a video conferencing/screen share app.

Unfortunately, one reality of computing, today, is that users sometimes end up with extensions or plugins they never intended acquiring. Another nice feature of browser extensions & plugins is their ease of installing & removing. Thus, if your browser starts acting funny on you, take a few minutes to make sure that you did not accidentally install a game or adware that you did not want.

In the Chrome browser, simply type `chrome://extensions` into the omnibox (i.e. the address bar) and (i) Enable, (ii) Disable, or (iii) Delete extensions. To review your browser’s plugins, type into the omnibox `chrome://plugins` and you will have the option to either enable or disable any plugins installed in your Chrome browser.
