Choosing an open source office suite does not require sacrificing compatibility with Microsoft Office programs. Let's face it, the most ubiquitous document formats across the legal profession are Microsoft Office and PDFs &ndash; with a small segment of the profession still clutching on to WordPerfect.

In true open-source fashion, [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/) does not lock users into any one specific format. While LibreOffice defaults to the [OpenDocument](http://www.opendocumentformat.org/) file format (ODF), this default can be easily changed to any one of many document formats.

### Saving Single Documents in Other Formats

1. Click on `File` => `Save As...`;
1. You will then see the `Save As` dialog;
1. In the `Save as type:` field, click on the drop-down arrow and select the desired format;
1. Finally, enter a unique name for your file in the `File name:` field and click on the `Save` button.

### Saving Documents in Other Formats by Default

If you want the `Save As` dialog to offer another file format as the default:

1. Click on `Tools` => `Options`;
1. Along the left side of the `Options` dialog, expand the `Load/Save` section by clicking on the `+` symbol and highlight the `General` subcategory;
1. In the `Default file format and ODF settings` area, find the `Document type` drop-down field and select a document type, such as `Text document`;
1. Then, select the file type for saving in the `Always save as` field;
1. Finally, click on the `OK` button to save your modifications.

> Feel free to repeat these steps for other Document Types, such as spreadsheets and presentations.

From now on, when you save a document, the file type will default to your choice. Of course, you remain free to select another file type in the `Save as type:` drop-down field.
